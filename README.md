# C-Language-Calculator

📘 C Programming Projects – Calculator & Grade Calculator
📌 Project Overview

This repository contains two basic C language projects:

🎓 Grade Calculator

🧮 Normal Calculator

Both programs are created using basic C concepts like:

Variables

Conditional Statements (if-else)

Switch Case

User Input (scanf)

Output (printf)

These projects are useful for beginners to understand core programming logic in C.

📖 Description

This program takes marks as input from the user and displays the grade according to the given condition.

🧠 Grading Criteria
Marks Range	Grade
90 and above	A
80 – 89	B
70 – 79	C
60 – 69	D
35 – 59	E
Below 35	Failed
⚙️ Concepts Used

if-else ladder

Integer variables

Comparison operators (>=)

User input/output

▶️ How to Run
gcc 1_Grade_calculator.c -o 1_Grade_calculator
./1_Grade_calculator

🖥️ Sample Output
Enter your Mark : 63
You have Achieved D grade.

🧮 2️⃣ Normal Calculator (2_Calculator.c)

📖 Description

This program performs basic arithmetic operations:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)

The user selects an operator and enters two numbers. The program performs the selected operation using switch-case.

⚙️ Concepts Used

switch statement

Arithmetic operators

Character input

Multiple user inputs

▶️ How to Run
gcc 2_Calculator.c -o 2_Calculator
./2_Calculator

🖥️ Sample Output
Operation :
+
Enter First Number:
5
Enter Second Number:
3
Addition : 8
